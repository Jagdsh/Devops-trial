# There can only be a single job definition per file. This job is named
# "example" so it will create a job with the ID and Name "example".

# The "job" stanza is the top-most configuration option in the job
# specification. A job is a declarative specification of tasks that Nomad
# should run. Jobs have a globally unique name, one or many task groups, which
# are themselves collections of one or many tasks.
#
# For more information and examples on the "job" stanza, please see
# the online documentation at:

      # The "template" stanza instructs Nomad to manage a template, such as

      # For more information and examples on the "template" stanza, please see
      # the online documentation at:
      #
      #     https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/template.html

      # The "template" stanza can also be used to create environment variables
      # for tasks that prefer those to config files. The task will be restarted
      # when data pulled from Consul or Vault changes.

      # The "vault" stanza instructs the Nomad client to acquire a token from
      # a HashiCorp Vault server. The Nomad servers must be configured and
      # authorized to communicate with Vault. By default, Nomad will inject
      # The token into the job via an environment variable and make the token
      # available to the "template" stanza. The Nomad client handles the renewal
      # and revocation of the Vault token.

      # the online documentation at:
